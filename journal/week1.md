# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## How to ask for help
I watched the how to ask for help video and found it very helpful.  I was stuck on an error all week with my notifications page and although I didn't have to ask for help in the discord I was able to navigate through and find a resolution.  It is very helpful if pages are spelled correctly if not you will get a 404 error that will drive you crazy for a few days.

## Notifications for Crudder application
I watched all videos pertaining to backend and front end notifications and was able to get my notifications page to successfully show.  Please see screenshot below.
